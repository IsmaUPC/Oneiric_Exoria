# Oneiric Exoria

![](https://github.com/IsmaUPC/Oneiric_Exoria/blob/master/docs/Wiki/Home/game_logo.png)

## Description

Welcome to Lansdowne, one of the few academies where magic is considered another area in scientific study. The students are divided into factions which compete with each other to show which one is the best. All magic and knowledge is allowed in the school except dark magic. If used, it would weaken the magical seal that keeps an old former student, Cassiel Dragneel who was exiled and locked in the Crazed dimension, allowing him a chance to escape, altering order and creating chaos. Our heroes will infiltrate the parallel dimension called Oneiric to prevent Cassiel Dragneel from reaching our world.

Oneiric Exoria is a 2d game based on an RPG with turn-based combat. The artistic style is pixel art using tiles with a top-down camera model.
